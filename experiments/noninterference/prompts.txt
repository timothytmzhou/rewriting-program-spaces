# Satisfiable Prompts
Write a simple imperative program over two variables, h and l, so that the final value of h is 4 plus the initial value of l and the final value of l is 5 less than the initial value of l.
Write a simple imperative program over two variables, h and l, so that the final value of h is 5 if the initial value of h is 1 and leaves h alond otherwise.
Write a simple imperative program over two variables, h and l, so that, if the initial value of l is 5, then the final value of h is 5 plus the initial value of h, and the final value of l is 1 plus the initial value of l if l is not initially 5.
Write a simple imperative program over two variables, h and l, so that the final value h to 10 and the final value of l is 10 factorial.
# Unsatisfiable Prompts
Write a simple imperative program over two variables, h and l, so that the final value of h is equal to the initial value of l.
Write a simple imperative program over two variables, h and l, so that the final value of l is 5 if the intial value of h is 3, but if the initial value of h is not 3, then h and l are unmodified.
Write a simple imperative program over two variables, h and l, so that the final value of l is 1 if h is 1 and 0 otherwise.
# Ambiguous Prompts
Write a simple imperative program over two variables, h and l, so that the final values of h and l sum to 10.
Write a simple imperative program over two variables, h and l, so that the final values of h and l are distinct.
