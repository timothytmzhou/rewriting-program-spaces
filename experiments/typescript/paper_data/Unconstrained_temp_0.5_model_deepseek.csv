False,1,mbpp_392_get_max_sum,0.5,18.464627265930176,False,"Here is how we can solve this problem using memoization technique where we store computed values so that if same value comes up again then instead of computing it again we directly take from stored result. This helps us reduce time complexity significantly as previously calculated results could easily fetch without recomputation which makes our approach more efficient than other approaches usually used. 

In TypeScript, we would define an array called ""mem"" initialized with -1s whose length equals to 'n' plus one because index starts at zero but since there may not exist any such integer 'i', we need space equal to next greater integer till 'n'. We also start computation from bottom-up i.e., first calculate all subproblems starting from smallest integers until reaching required integer 'n'.

We recursively call helper() method inside main function named getMaxSum(). As per above explanation, base case returns when current input becomes less than or equal to zero while recursive step calculates the total sum based on provided formula. Here, we have applied dynamic programming concept of storing intermediate computations into mem[] array thereby avoiding repeated work. The final answer returned by main function getsMaxSum(n);.

Code Snippet :

```typescript
let mem: Array<number>; // Declare global variable here
    
function get_max_sum(n: number): number{
  	mem= new Array(n+6).fill(-1); // Initialize memory table with size n + 6 filled with '-1'

In geometry, all five corners of a regular pentagon have equal angles which means they form 5-10-90-80-72 degrees angle pattern. Since it forms a straight line on each corner, thus if 'n' unit segments make up this shape then there must be n+4 lines that intersect at any point inside the polygon making sure all points lie within the polygon hence forming a closed path meaning the total units traveled would give us the Perimeter i.e., P = 5*n where ""n"" represents the length of individual segment making up the Pentagon. Hence, calculating just by knowing one sideâ€™s measurement, we get :

```typescript
function perimeter_pentagon(sideLength: number): number{
   const NUMBER_OF_SIDES= 5 ; // A constant representing the number of sides in a pentagon
   let result =NUMBER_OF_SIDES * sideLength;      // Calculating the perimeter

This approach works because any integer has at least one pair of factors which when squared give us back our original input i.e., A^2 >= B * C where A>=B & C >= 1.

The calculation assumes that every corner point lies exactly perpendicularly from opposite corners of the quadrilaterals making them equilateral triangles and hence uses simple trigonometric functions tan() instead of complex geometry calculations. Note that we're assuming here that the angle between any diagonal line of base and corresponding straight lines extending downwards towards other vertices is 60 degrees.

This function checks whether given input number ""num"" is a non-prime number. It returns ""true"" if the number is composite otherwise ""false"". The logic behind this algorithm works as follows - A Composite Number must have at least one Divisor which lies between square root of that number upto that number itself. Hence checking till square root reduces time complexity drastically. Also all known Prime Numbers occur at position where they divide without leaving remainder except those being divided themselves e.g., 4=2*x etc. This property makes our job simpler while implementing the same.- So when there exists such x satisfying condition mentioned above ,it signifies that n is Non-Prime .

In our case, base = 2 because the sequence is about calculating powers of 2 starting from zero. We then subtract each term from 1 as per requirement.

We need to convert our inputs from kilometers per hour into miles per hour because the formula uses imperial measurements. Conversion factor would be multiplying KMH value by 0.621371. After performing calculations we round up the result to get nearest whole number. This could also be done via Math library's ceil method but since there seems no built-in ceiling operation in Typescript, manual rounding has been used here. Here is what one possible way may look like:

(factorial) iteratively without storing every intermediate result due to their huge size. We calculate each step modulo 10 because any multiplication operation keeps only its least significant decimal place which contributes towards determining the final outcome at all steps. Here's the complete Typescript Function :

This script finds out the last digit of the factorial of input '5'. You may replace '5' with other integers depending on what value you want to compute the factorial of. The concept behind this approach comes under modular arithmetic where properties such as distributivity allow us not to store large amounts of data leading to efficient solutions. This also handles edge cases well when dealing with larger inputs since even if one partials results become zero then further multiplications do not change them thus preserving information about higher digits. It works perfectly fine within JavaScript runtime environment too. Please note though that while Javascript/Typescript supports arbitrarily long integer operations via BigInt(), but these calculations take considerable time compared to normal scenario hence above mentioned method provides good optimized way around it.

In mathematics, any sequence of positive integers whose general term is obtained from the previous one according to some fixed rule may be called a ""sequence"". The terms of such sequences must satisfy certain conditions that depend upon their generating functions. In other words, each new entry depends only on its neighbors but not all prior entries. This property makes it possible to generate many types of useful sequences without knowing where they would start.

A pattern emerges when looking at Hexagonal Numbers which follow a specific arithmetic progression. Specifically, if 'H' represents the N-th Hexagonal Number then it follows a relation between successive hexagonal numbers given by :
    `2N+1 = Summation[i=0 to i=6] + 3*Summation[(j=0)to(k)] - j`
Where Summation signifies the generalized harmonic sums used commonly in similar problems involving geometric shapes/numbers etc., also here k varies depending on whether odd or even indexed element is being calculated respectively.

If this operation returns true then our resultant value x must indeed represent an ODD NUMBER otherwise it means that X represents EVEN NUMBER. Hereâ€™s the Typescript equivalent to what I explained above :-

```typescript

This Function takes one argument namely -> numberToCheck & checks its Parity . It Returns True if the Given Input Is An Odd Number Else False indicating That The Provided Number Was Either Zero Or Even. We used double negation operator here since JavaScript considers zero as false so returning TRUE on checking against FALSE ensures proper identification based on number being either zero or non-zero.

The last part of condition just handles edge cases where our loop didnâ€™t find any divisors but number was determined to be not Prime so far only when its more than 2.

For every next step, we increment our current value by 2 because only these values are required here which represent all odd integers starting from 3rd element onwards. The calculation part involves squaring that result three times (to get its cube), then raising it four more times (getting forth power). This process continues until 'n'. Here is one way to implement such logic into Typescript:

The check on Integer ensures only those values pass through where they become squares ie., 4^2 = 16, etc,. This approach prevents any non-integer results as per definition of Perfect Square.

False,69,mbpp_96_divisor,0.5,18.123895168304443,False,"Here is how we can solve this problem by creating a Typescript function that calculates the count of all factors (divisors) of a positive integer n: 

This method works because every composite number has at least one prime factor less than its square root. So if there's no such i < sqrt(n), then it means that n must have been divided evenly onto itself as many times as possible along way up until reaching sqrt(n). If not, let say when last division happens on qth step, then each next part from m=sqrt(n)/q+1 till infinity would definitely divide 'n'. As result, counting only half of them wouldnâ€™t affect our final answer. Thus, complexity becomes O(sqrt(N)) which makes algorithm faster compared to previous ones.  

We keep track of total divisors by incrementing twice - once per found pair of factors and also separately for single instances where both factors coincide since they form perfect squares. The latter case needs special handling due to their double-counted nature within pairs.

So here goes the simple but efficient approach:

```typescript
function divisor(num :number ) : number{      // start off assuming num doesn't have any proper factors
        var cnt = 0 ;          
        
       /* loop through potential first/second number */    
          for(var i =1;i*i<=num;++i){               
               if((num % i ==0)){                    // check whether current iteration meets criteria                
                   if ((num / i)==i)                  //first condition checks if both values equal (excluding zero)->perfect Square
                        cnt += 1 ;                    
                   else                                // second condition sums up counts properly
                       cnt +=2;}                      }  
            return cnt;}                             //return resulting counter value

function jacobsthal_num(n: number): number {
    if (n === 0) {
        return 0; // Base case 1

    } else {
        return 2*jacobsthalNum(n-1)+jacobsthalNum(n-2);
    }
}
```
This approach has exponential time complexity due to repeated calculations involved in finding smaller terms. A more efficient way would involve memoization which stores intermediate results so they do not need to be recomputed again when needed later. However, Typescript does not support tail call optimization out of box unlike languages that have builtin support such as Python or Java. Thus, it may cause stack overflow error while trying to calculate large values. Therefore, considering these factors, above simple recursive method works fine but could fail at larger inputs because of exceeding maximum call stack size limit.

False,72,mbpp_765_is_polite,0.5,18.283773183822632,False,"In mathematics, A polite number can be defined as those positive integers that can represent their binary counterparts by concatenating 1s followed only by 0s (or vice versa). For instance, all three first polite numbers are represented respectively by 2 (which represents ""10"" when read as if it was a binary), 5 (""101"") and 6 (""110""). In this context, we could say that any integer greater than one which does not contain consecutive ones in its binary representation would qualify as a polite number. Here's how such a function may look written in Typescript:

```typescript
function is_polite(num: number) : string{  
     let count = 0 , i=1 ;
      while(count < num){
          const bin = i++.toString(2); // Convert current decimal number into binary format

       	while((bin.indexOf('11') !== -1)){ 
             bin.replace(/1+/, ""X"");
               }      
           	if(!~bin.indexOf(""11"")) count ++ ;             		                 	   	 	     
	}                	       									                        			 	
	return --i .toString();

console.log(getNthPoliteNumber(3));                              
```
This script starts from 1 upwards incrementally converting each value into binary form then checks every time against conditions. When condition met increases polite count variable. The loop continues till politeness count reaches given input parameter. At last returns previous valid result because index start from zero hence decremented at final line.

This script checks each pair of input variables against one another. When it finds that there exists any amount of pairs where all elements within these sets match exactly then it increments its internal tally-counter accordingly - thus providing us with some sort of 'score'. This score indicates not only the quantity but also quality/nature of matches found between provided set members.
