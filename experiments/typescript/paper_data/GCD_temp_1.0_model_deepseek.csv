// A simple recursive method could work but it's not efficient due to repeated calculation of subproblems. So we need to compute iteratively following Fibonacci series formula which is more effective here although Jacobsthal’s sequence also has something called as Binet Formula that may make computation faster than linear folding approach above (also known combinatorial species based approaches - those have advantages over direct recurrence relations). We chose this way because it doesn’t require matrix exponentiation unlike standard Recursion one would usually do when solving similar subproblem depending problems such as Hamming Numbers by Euclid etc., Thereby making few lower hanging fruits easier whereas total pickets becomes intractably big yet attainable fractions instead.
