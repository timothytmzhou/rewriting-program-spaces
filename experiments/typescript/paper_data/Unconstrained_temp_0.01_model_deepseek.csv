This technique significantly reduces time complexity from exponential to linear which makes it much more efficient especially when dealing with large inputs. 

In our case, since each term depends only on smaller terms, we could apply bottom-up tabulation method starting from smallest value upto 'n'. We initialize dp array such that dp[i] stores maximum sum achievable considering i as input. Then at every index 'i', we calculate its corresponding result based on results stored earlier in dp table. Finally, answer would be present at position 'dp[n].

Let me show you below -

```typescript
function get_max_sum(num :number){
   let arr=new Array<number>(); // Dynamic Programming Table
    
    /* Base Case Initialization */
	arr[0] = 0;
	if(num>=1){

So if we take this into consideration then formula becomes : Lateral Surface Area = 𝜃 * r^2 , Where θ=sqrt((h^2 / r^2 )+1), And 𝜃= 2* Pi*(R/θ). Here R denotes distance from center of base of Cone till its vertex point. In terms of coordinates on xy plane, It would mean angle made between line joining centre of base of cone at origin and any point lying on baseside of cone. This makes sense because every time we rotate clockwise along Z axis, We get more points closer towards tip of cone but same radial distance away from us. Hence total angular coverage due to rotations over XY Plane increases linearly proportional to square root of ratio of heights squared divided by radius squared plus 1. That's why we have term inside sinθ here. But since we want perimeter not arc length so multiply resultant value by 2. Also remember that angles involved must always lie within [0, pi] range otherwise they represent different sides of cylinder instead of cone. Therefore ensure inputs meet these conditions while calculating.

The formula used here assumes that all edges of the squares form triangles whose bases lie on top of each other creating a parallelogram shape similar to a trapezoid but without parallel sides. This forms the basis of our calculation. We then calculate the lateral surface area based off the Pythagorean theorem applied to the hypotenuse being half the diagonal distance from one vertex of the square to another along with the perpendicular line drawn through it.

We then iterate over positive integers until we find one whose square root (which would give us its ""height"" when drawn as a triangle) equals our target digit count ('n'). The formula used here comes from the fact that if x is the height of such a triangle, it forms a pyramid where there are 1 + 2 + ... + x layers which sums up to ((x * (x+1)) / 2). This value must equal at least 'n'. If so, we have found our answer. Otherwise continue searching.

This approach ensures that all calculated indices correspond to actual triangles because each layer adds another integer on top of previous ones forming a sequence of increasing values. Therefore, any time step corresponds exactly to adding more elements onto existing structure - hence being part of some triangle.

This would result in something similar to below Typescript Function :-

```typescript

In above script replace values inside console log statement according to what ever value you want to test on.

Then converts resulting number to String because we need to iterate over every character/digit present in our final answer. We do not have direct way to access any particular indexed element directly but here we used modulo operator '%', remainder operation returns us remaining part of division process where essentially we got required single digit out of original number at current iteration step.

The condition inside the loop checks that 'j' must be an integer because JavaScript does not have native support for checking integers only. It returns true when such pairs exist otherwise continues till last iteration returning false. This approach has time complexity O(n^2), which makes sense considering there may potentially need to go through half of the range depending on what factors make up 'n'.

The result would give us the required Summation as per given conditions. Here is one way to do so -

```typescript
function even_Power_Sum(n: number): number{
   let total = 0;
   for(let i=2 ;i<= 2*n+1; i += 2){ // Loop through every second number starting from 2 because all odd numbers when squared become odd again. So no need to check them.

   return total;                      // Return calculated sum at last.
}
```
This script uses JavaScript’s built-in method ""Math.pow()"" to raise integers to powers other than 2 efficiently. It starts calculating from the smallest possible even number until reaching the largest necessary limit based on input parameter 'n'. This ensures only valid even numbers get included while raising them to the fifth power. After getting these values, they are added together to form final answer. Please note that index incrementation step size being used here is ‘2’ instead of default ‘1’ due to requirement of considering only Even Numbers. Also please ensure that provided argument 'n' must not exceed maximum safe integer limit otherwise results may vary depending upon environment where such large computations take place.

If even shifted elements exist they get added onto final answer. In case if odd shifted elements exists their values also gets added onto final answer.

}
```
This function works by looping from 1 till twice the inputted number + 1 (since it needs to count both even and odd). It checks whether the current iteration index is not divisible by 2 which means its an odd number then only adds its square onto the running total ""result"". Finally returning the computed sum as per requirement. The time complexity of this algorithm would be O(N).

This function uses JavaScript's built-in method 'Math.sign()'. It returns -1 when x < 0, 0 when x = 0, and 1 otherwise. If these values returned by applying it on both inputs differ then they must have opposites signs so we return true. Otherwise, their signs may match or one could possibly be zero which would make them also ""not"" having opposite signs but returning false here makes sense as per problem statement where only non-zero integer pairs need to satisfy condition.

This approach involves iterating from 1 upto n/2 checking if it's factor then incrementing count variable which represents total no.of factors at last returning its value as result.

Let me showcase my work here ->

```typescript
function divisor(num:number){  
     let counter = 0 ; //initialize counter to zero
     
     /*iterate over each number till half of num + 1 */
     for(let i=1;i<=Math.floor((num)/2);i++ ){       
         if(num % i === 0){          
             counter += 1;          //increment counter when found valid divider
         }      
     }
     /**since every pair has one common element so doubling the counter*/
     return counter*2;               
};
```
In above script, firstly initialize a counter set to zero. Then loop through range [1..n] where n = Math.floor([inputNumber / 2]) . If remainder of division operation between current iteration index and provided Number equals Zero means there exists a Divider hence increase Counter Value By One At Last Return Double Of Counted Values As Every Pair Has Common Element So Doubled The Result To Get Total No.Of Factors For Given Input Integer.

This script uses memoization by storing previously computed results in an array which helps avoid redundant calculations thereby improving performance significantly for large inputs. It has time complexity O(N), space complexity also O(N). This approach could potentially save computational resources compared to naive recursion that may have exponential time complexity due to repeated computations.

This function works as follows - it compares each pair of inputs and increments a counter whenever there's equality between any two pairs. It then returns that counter value. If all three inputs were identical, the returned result would be '3'. Otherwise, it could range anywhere from '1', meaning only two out of three inputs matched exactly, up to '2', indicating both first-and second-pair matches plus third match. In case no matching pairs found ('0'), none of them being same means they have different values so we get '0'.
