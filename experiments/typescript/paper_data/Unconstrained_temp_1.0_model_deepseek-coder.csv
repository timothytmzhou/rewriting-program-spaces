This particular conversion depends on developed human-to-dog year Ratios: For instance , Human Years Equal To :15 Dog Yars (approx). But some dogs seemingly grow more quickly than others so first approximation usually used was that every human year corresponds approximately to around dozen dog years . So let us take into consideration 7 human years equals equal to one ""dozen"" - 20/4=5 ten doze years which roughly alignes smoothly because approx as per our ratio they coincide at these conversions.. Assuming even distribution between them produces AgeConversion = `humanYears * 5`

It uses bitwise operations which improves performance slightly over standard mathematical operation libraries used by languages such as Python:
