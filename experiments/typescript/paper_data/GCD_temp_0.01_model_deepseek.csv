// The formula used here is based on mathematical definition of Tetrahedron Number which can also be defined as binomial coefficient C(4,2) * (n^3 - 6*n + 10). This equation comes from solving the recurrence relation given by the problem statement.

// Here we have implemented this formula directly into our Typescript Function.

// We start at index zero because it's more common convention when counting starts from one instead of zero. If starting count was already set then adjust accordingly while calling the function.

// Also note that there may exist different ways to calculate tetrahedral numbers depending upon how they were initially defined but above method seems most commonly known. So please ensure understanding about these concepts if required.

// In terms of time complexity, since only single operation 'multiplication/subtraction/power calculation' happens inside loop so overall time complexity would still remain O(1), constant time ie., no matter what value of input 'n', execution takes same amount of time irrespective of size of 'n'. Hence efficient even for large inputs.

// And space complexity being linear ie., O(1), means memory usage remains constant regardless of size of input 'n'. Therefore quite optimal too.

Then we multiply it by radius r (which equals half the given side 'a' because our shape has been drawn such that center-to-vertex distance along x axis forms base).

// The logic behind this approach is simple binary shifting operation which checks each bit from most significant (MSB) till least significant (LSB). When we encounter first '1', it means all bits on its right side form part of our result so just shift those many times by one position towards MSB i.e., subtract these positions from total length.

// This works because when we have consecutive ones at start of binary representation then they represent powers of 2 starting from zero. So if there's any gap between them, it represents missing powers of 2. We can simply ignore such gaps as their values would not contribute while calculating final answer. Hence, only consider sequence of continuous ones until we get first '0'. That index tells us maximum possible value of x where 2^x <= N.

// For instance, let’s take N = 37. Its binary equivalent is 100101. Here, longest string of consecutive ‘1’ starts from bit no. 4 & ends at bit no. 5. It implies max X = log base 2 [number] - 1 = 6. But actually, largest power of 2 <= 37 is 32 (which has exponent 5), hence actual answer is 2 ^ 5 = 32.
