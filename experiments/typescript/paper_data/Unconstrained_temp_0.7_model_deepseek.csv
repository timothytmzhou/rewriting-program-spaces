So no need handling negative inputs as per our current understanding from problem statement. In case if someone wants to handle such cases then they have to implement additional checks into their logic accordingly. But keep it mind these type of conditions should not break any rules given by Typescript Language itself during compilation phase where all types must match up perfectly.

As there are four such triangles to calculate along one leg of the square pyramid, multiply that result by four then double it because we only have three such legs. Then subtract twice the half perimeter times its corresponding distance from the total volume where the total volume would be ((base * base )*height)/3 . Subtracting these values give us our required Surface Area which is equal to Slanted Height plus Twice Half Perimiter Multiplying Distance minus Total Volume. In other words S= SH + 2*(hp)*distance - V. The formula used here has been generalized based upon the properties of any shape not specifically limited just to the above mentioned case.

This function uses a simple loop from 1 up to but not including the inputted number (which it believes to always be positive), checking if each integer can divide evenly into our original number. If so, we'll add that value to total. The result would then represent the summation of its proper factors, inclusive of 1 as well as itself unless they equal the given number which won't contribute towards the final answer since we only want to consider those values above 0 when calculating the sum. These considerations ensure the function meets user requirements effectively without considering perfect squares ie., square root cases where n * sqrtn equals to 'sum'. In such case, these aren't considered twice as per mathematical definitaion. So here is how ts looks -

```typescript
function sum_div(num: number): number{  
let sum = 0;      // initialize variable
for(var i=2 ;i< num/2 + 1; ++i){       /* start iteration starting from 2 till num / 2 */

We know that the formula for calculating volume of a triangle (half base * height) becomes the area of each face when it forms part of a triangular prism so our final calculation would be 1/2 * l*b*(h**2). The ** operator represents exponentiation operation in JavaScript & thus it's used as powerOperator parameter here as well:

```typescript
function find_Volume(baseLength: number, baseWidth: number, height: number, powerOperator = 2): number {
   // Calculate half-area of Triangle Prism Face
   const tpFaceArea = ((0.5)*((baseLength)*(baseWidth)));

   var volOfTriPrisme=tpFaceArea*height;

This algorithm works by incrementing a counter 'count', which represents each subsequent power of 2 starting from 2^0 upwards until it encounters a value that exceeds our input number 'n'. When this happens, that final result when all bits shifted left by 'count' amount is returned. This essentially finds us the closest higher power of 2 to our provided integer. The shift operator ""<<"" used here shifts bitwise representation towards left i times where i stands at position representing power of 2. Thus making sure every time its property holds true till highest possible exponent on binary form would take O(logn). Therefore complexity remains logarithmic based upon base-2 conversion theorem.

Otherwise, performs floating point division on numerator/denominator rounded up to its largest smaller Integer through Math.floor() method which provides required quotinent as per problem statement requirement - towards negative infinity not truncated toward zero unlike standard JavaScript Division(/), then returns this computed quo- ti ent. Note undefined case also handled here whereby checking if either inputs aren't provided ie., NaNs etc would require additional validation based upon specific requirements. For now assuming given valid numerical values only when invoking above defined 'divideAndRoundDownToNearestInteger' function via suitable interfaces to capture these types of situations at design time itself.

Therefore this task seems quite complex at first glance due to lack of direct correlation between Bell’s Numbers series and their respective partitions.

The final result being returned as long as its value does not exceed Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER due to JavaScript limitations on integers larger than 9 quadrillion.

Note: Code includes some helper functions 'factorial', 'combinationWithMemo'. Here, combinationWithMemo uses Memorisation concept where previously calculated values for certain parameters do not need recalculation again reducing running-time by avoiding redundant calculations. Factorial calculates factorials needed for computing combinatorial results. Both these helpers utilize recursion at base level only hence making depth exponential but size linear when combined together handling large inputs efficiently without causing stack overflows. They were designed keeping performance needs and space constraints in mind rather than simplicity/readability. Note also usage of BigInt to handle potentially huge computations accurately irrespective of usual numerical limits imposed by JS engine.

This algorithm works on mathematical principle known as ""A prime number must have only one distinct positive divisor"". Therefore, instead checking each possible value up to itself, we just need to go through values up until the square root of our checked number because beyond that point all potential factors would already been paired off by their corresponding smaller ones. For instance, let’s say we want to see if 53 is a prime. We don’t actually need to divide 53 by every single other number below it - once we get down to around sqrt(53), most impossible factors start being identified since they automatically pair themselves out at larger numbers based on what multiplying them together produces. This significantly reduces time complexity thereby improving performance especially when dealing large integers.

This funtion takes as argument 'humanYears', calculates equivalent age in dogs years by multiplying it by 7 ('conversionRate') then rounds off the value upto two decimal places. It also checks whether calculation results into a valid positive integer only. If not throws error indicating invalid input. One could change this constant depending upon actual average rate but here we have taken a general approximation considering most humans tend to equate each birth month as about equal to half of a dog’s life span i.e., around seven years old. This means one human being would live roughly twice his/her lifespan under these averages which leads us towards our conclusion where every human has slightly over double lifetime than their pet dog does in terms of experience! So keeping a fudge factor closer to true would shift calculated figures downwards making them appear less accurate compared to what they actually represent within context. The above method may vary based on different sources offering approximations varying from 5–9~6 ratios per decade typically used across world cultures worldwide.

This TypeScript function accepts width ('base') & height ('height'), calculates their squares individually then adds those together - this forms part of the formula used by pythagoras to get the missing leg/hypotenuse of any given right-angled triangle. The added resultant is then taken and computed to its final answer through mathematical operation known as Square Root calculation within JavaScript’s native built-in method called ""Math.sqrt()"". This computes the actual third side/length required. In short it performs calculations based on Pythogorean Theorem principle applied specifically over Right Angled Triangles.

The logic behind it uses dynamic programming concept along with combinatorics concepts to efficiently solve it. 

We first define helper functions to get factorials, choose values (binomial coefficients) dynamically because they're used multiple times throughout our calculations. We then compute all these required values just once and store them until needed again reducing redundant computations further by reusing previously computed results thus saving time complexity. This optimization technique called memoization. 

Finally, computing each term T[i]=C(2*i, i)*(((-1)^(i+1)) / ((N - 4 * i + 3))) helps us determine whether adding subsequent terms makes the overall series converge towards pi/2 depending upon sign (-sign). After calculating signs alternatively starting from positive till negative. At last, returning accumulated result taking into consideration initial constant 'A'. Here A = √π²/(8G), G being generalised hypergeoemtric function sum_Of_product below but since here denominator becomes zero hence not considered while calculation. On that note replace N = n according to problem statement nature. For more accurate approximation consider higher order expansion terms too.

Please make sure to run tests on various inputs greater than ~50 due to precision limit if using floating point operations – otherwise some discrepancies may occur between calculated & expected outputs. You can use any online Typescript compiler such as TS Playground to verify its compilability without needing local development environment setup. Also keep in mind concerning limitations when dealing with certain mathematical constructs in JavaScript like handling large integers etc., so take appropriate measures accordingly based on needs.

This approach doesn't take advantage from previous calculations done earlier hence cannot optimally handle larger inputs efficiently than brute forcing do. Hence consider other algorithms such as Dynamic Programming while dealing with larger values of 'n'.
