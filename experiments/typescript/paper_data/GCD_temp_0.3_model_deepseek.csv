// Here is how we can solve this problem by creating a loop that subtracts twice 'i' each time until it reaches zero.

// We start at index 1 because our initial value needs not to decrease further than once per iteration. So starting point would have been already decreased one more time due to incrementing step size as well which makes us skip first element while calculating series.

// The logic here is simple, keep decreasing 'n' by double its current value till it becomes less than equal to zero. At every stage store resultant values into variable named ""sum"". This way all results get accumulated over iterations thereby giving final answer.

// Let's implement above steps through below Typescript Function.

  // Function to calculate Factorial
  // This is done by calculating each multiplication modulo 10 which helps us get only the last non-zero digit as it changes every time we multiply by another integer.
  
  // Helper function that calculates power under modulus m

// This is a dynamic programming problem where we keep track of previous states (previous post's color)

After all these steps finally get the first non-zero digits.

// Function to determine if x and y have opposing signs (i.e., one is positive and the other negative)

// We can solve this by checking if both values multiply together as negative 1 (-1). If they do that means their signs were different when multiplied which indicates they had differing signs originally.

// This also works because multiplication has the property where -a * b = -(-a*b), so it effectively negates any value we've already seen once more. Hence, if our inputs ever cancel out at all then we know there was some cancellation involved and thus those inputted numbers must indeed share same sign initially. But since we only get here if 'y != 0', we conclude that these two numbers don’t match up on initial sign. So either 'x' & 'y' didn't start off having matching signs or else 'y = 0'. In case of latter being true, false would be returned immediately without even needing to perform further checks hence making algorithm efficient.

// Create a matrix where each cell [i][j] represents the result when calling ""euler"" method with parameters i & j respectively. Initialize all cells to null initially.

// We need to subtract one from both dimensions because they start at zero but represent indices starting at one. So dimension starts at index 1 not 0 so that makes them off by one compared to mathematical representation.

// Also note that since JavaScript does not support negative array indexes directly accessing element out of bound would throw error instead of returning expected results hence size needs to be increased by one more than maximum required input. In case inputs were larger than anticipated increase the initialisation part accordingly.

// For instance here let us assume max possible value of either n or m could go till 50. Then initialize matrix of size 51*51.

// A Woodall Number can be represented as 2^p -1 where p itself is also a power of 2 plus one (i.e., it has form 4k+3). So we need to find such 'p' that satisfies this condition. If there exists any such 'p', then x would indeed be a Woodall number otherwise not.

// This helper recursive method finds whether n is divisible by some other integer apart from 1 & itself which means its composite hence not prime.

// The base case when n = 0 || 1 returns false because they aren’t primes but true indicates found non-prime factor i.e., composites so no prime factors exist thus returning true indicating all unique factors including only themselves being prime. Hence checking primality here saves us time over iterating till sqrt(n) unlike traditional methods.

// Recursively calling the same until remainder becomes zero at which point either loop breaks due to reaching zero or we have discovered common divider thereby confirming existence of non-prime/composite factors. Thus saving computation on unnecessary iterations.

// We don't even require division operation nor modulo arithmetic operations reducing complexity drastically making our approach efficient.
