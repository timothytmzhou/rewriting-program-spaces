// A Tetrahedron is a pyramid-shaped three dimensional solid object that has 4 triangular faces. Each face of this shape can have its own orientation so it also forms part of the cubic symmetry group. The formula used by mathematicians to calculate Nth term of series (where 'N' starts from zero) representing sequence of tetrahedral numbers is given as follows :
// t[0] = 0 , t[1]=1, t[2] =5 ...... where each next value equals previous one plus four times current position.
  


// Here we implement above logic into our Typescript Function named ""tetrahedralNumber"". It takes integer input 'n', calculates corresponding tetrahedral number and returns calculated result.

// Creating array to hold computed results upto 'n'. Initializing all elements as -1 which indicates not yet processed.
// We start index at position zero because our first computation is going on position ""0"" ie., when no coins available. So this helps us avoid base case conditions while applying recursion logic. 

// This approach has time complexity O(N), space complexity also O(N) due to usage of extra memory storage.

// For storing pre-calculated sums

// Initialize cache with initial condition set to -1

// Here size + 1 since we want indices starting from 0 till numsSize inclusive. Hence adding additional element in front makes sure even if last part goes out of bounds we still have some valid state.

// Actual DP starts from index = 1 hence loop running from index=1 until length+1 including both ends.

// Note: If input was negative than its absolute equivalent would actually fit within JS Number range without overflow error. But generally handling such cases isn’t good practice unless explicitly told otherwise. In most languages other than JavaScript negatives aren’t supported naturally. Thus taking only positive integers inputs assuming they fall under typical constraints.

// Perimeter of a Regular Pentagon is given by 5 times side length (s) i.e., P = 5 * s.

// Function Definition

// The parameter 'a' represents the length of one side of the pentagon.
// We assume that all five sides have equal lengths as it forms a regular polygon.
// This function returns the total perimeter of the pentagon which can be calculated via formula :-  5*sideLength.

// Start Code Block

// Here we define our main function named ""perimeter_pentagon"" taking single argument 'a'.
// It calculates the perimeter of any regular pentagon where each side has same units/length denoted as 'a', then returns this value.

// Main Function Body

// Our main body consists of simple arithmetic operation - multiplication here so directly returning result through calculation.

// Ending Code block

// Return statement giving us final answer.

// Example usage could follow below format --> console.log(perimeter_pentagon(3)); // Should print out 15 because a pentagon with side length 3 would have a perimeter of 15 units if they were all straight lines.

  // Here we'll first get the integer part of the square root of 'n', then compute the square of it. If it matches 'n', we know 'n' was originally a perfect square. Otherwise, it wasn’t a perfect square.

  // Importing math module from Typescript standard library which provides functions for mathematical operations on numeric types. Specifically Math.sqrt() method returns the positive square root of a number.

  // Firstly import the built-in ""Math"" namespace into our script so we have access to methods within it. Then, calculate the square root rounded down (using Math.floor) as well as upwards. Compare these results against each other - they must match exactly otherwise 'n' cannot be a whole number because squares always yield integers when their inputs do too.

  // The result could either be true indicating that 'n' is indeed a perfect square, or false meaning it isn't.

  // Note : This approach works only if the input value is non negative. For handling negative values also one more condition needs to added where absolute value of floor squared would give us ceiling value and vice versa. But since question requires just plain old positives hence no need to handle negatives here.

  // Now let's implement it.

// For calculating slant length s we can use Pythagorean theorem which states that ""a² + b² = c²"". In this case it becomes ((h/sinθ)^2+r^2=s^2). Hence solving above equation would give us 'sqrt((h*h)/(tanθ*tanθ))' as our value of 's'. We then calculate θ by taking arc cosine of base divided by hypotenuse ie., acos(base / sqrt(hypo)). Therefore, at last we get the lateral surface area of cone as l = 0.5 * 3.14159... * r*(r + sqrt((height * height )/(tandifference))); where tandifference = tan(acoshalfangle); so finally we have =>l= √[(h/sinθ)]*pi*r .

And we can calculate that by taking sqrt[l² - ((b / 3 )²)] ,where l is length of one side of pyramid which can also be calculated as follows := sqrt[(s²)-((b*sqrt(3))�6)²] .But here I am considering all sides equal so just divide total sides into three parts ie.,s = S/3 then solve above equation accordingly.  

// Here, b represent Base Edge & s represents Side Edges Of Trapezoidal Face In Triangular Partitioning And Not Total Sides Of Pyramid But Half That So Calculate It As Below := s = S/(3).

// This function is_Diff a single argument n which represents any integer value. It then checks if this inputted number can be divided evenly (without remainder) into another whole number called 'diff'. If so, it returns true indicating that the given number is divisible by diff without leaving a remainder. Otherwise, it returns false indicating otherwise. The logic behind determining division-ability follows from basic mathematics principles whereby every natural number has at least one unique pair of factors - namely 1 and itself. Thus, all integers greater than 0 have some other factor besides themselves unless they're prime numbers themselves which always default as being non-divisors except possibly when checking against 1. Hence we only need to check up until sqrt(n), since beyond there would just repeat smaller values.

// Base Case : If 'N' equals zero then returns Zero (End Condition)
// Induction Hypothesis : Assuming that it works fine until current term i.e., 'N'. Let us assume this as T(N).
// Inductive Step : We need to prove about next step which means we have calculated the value from previous steps so let’s say if S(N - 1), where S represents our resultant series at each stage. Now, we can construct equation based on these results. The new element added into the sequence becomes ‘previous term / power of 2’. So, now we just replace “S” with “S + Series[current term]” and reduce problem size to one less term recursively calling GSum() again. This way, proof follows through induction process.

  // If both base is zero or exponent is less than one ie., [0^n] ,[1^m], result would always be either zero or one respectively. Hence returning accordingly here.
  // In case if exponent is greater than equal to Zero ie.[x^0] where x could be any real no including negatives, answer would always be One regardless whether its positive/negative hence returning One.
    
  // Below approach works fine even when base itself includes leading zeros but those get ignored while calculating powers due to floating point precision issues inherently present within JavaScript. So I have decided against taking account such cases too.

  // Counting divisors from 1 upto n (inclusive)
  // And then checking if that count is odd or not
  
  // The main logic here would be to find all factors of 'n' by iterating over each integer till sqrt('n') because factor pairs can occur beyond square root ('n'). If they do cross sqrt('n'), we start seeing duplicate counts already counted. So, it’s enough to go just until sqrt('n'). Also, remember to consider both pair <i, j> as one unique pair when i != j so don't forget to exclude this case where only one number itself becomes a valid divisor which happens at prime numbers. That means starting from 0th index onwards increment counter every time while searching for any possible match. At last compare its value against 2 and see if it returns true indicating even otherwise false suggesting there were odds amounts of them.
  // This algorithm has O(sqrt(N)) complexity due to loop running for approximately sqrt(N). Hence providing efficient results irrespective of large inputs N.

  // But also note that our first actual input starts from 1 hence adjust accordingly during calculations

// Also remember volumetric calculations involve floating point arithmetic so precision loss might occur due to calculation process itself but considering practical purposes those values returned from our functions must suffice enough.

// Using bitwise operators to calculate the next power of 2
// If 'n' is already a power of 2 then it returns double value as per problem statement but we can handle this scenario by returning -1 if user wants minimum possible integer that cannot be represented so here I am considering edge case where input could not represent any given positive int into negative which results in error hence handling such cases too.

// Edge Cases Handling...if entered num less than zero (unrepresentable)
// It also handles large inputs since JavaScript represents all integers upto Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER limit plus one more due to being signed representation range.

// This method works because when x has its least significant bits set to 0s, adding 1 makes them become 1s making sure they form continuous sequence from last power of 2 till now thus giving us required resultant min power.  
    
      // The trick is subtracting 1 first before checking whether it’s a Power Of Two Or Not. Because while doing AND operation between X & X-1 ,it sets off those trailing zeros ie., Offsets leading ones at their original places effectively removing these offsetting onces turning our potential answer back onto normal binary format again thereby ensuring resulting minimal nonnegative integral representing some positive real world quantity.
      
       

// For other valid scenarios calculation proceeds normally..for instance calculating nextPowerOfTwo(5),returns 8 etc.

// The formula used here is derived from Heron's Formula which calculates 
//the area of any triangle given its three sides (a, b & c). In this context however, as we know that our tetrahedron has all four equal side lengths, it simplifies calculations significantly.

// For each face/triangle inside the Tetrahedron, calculate Area by applying herons formula on those faces ie., sqrt[4*a^2 - h^2] where 'h' represents height calculated through cosine rule.

// Using standard equation of calculating volume V = s^3 / (6 * sqrt(2)), derive edge length 'a'. Then apply Volume=Area*Height so get Height also. Now substitute these values into Cosine Rule to find out third angle θ. Use Law Of Cosecs to convert angles between degrees and radians if necessary since Typescript Math functions operate only in Radian form.

// Finally compute area of one Face via above method then multiply resultant value by 4 to obtain total surface area.

// The formula used here is derived from the area calculation where A = 0.5 * (a+b)h 
// Here 'a' represents one side of the trapezoid while 'b' signifies other side and h stands for its height. Hence we can rearrange this equation as follows -> h = A / ((a+b)/2). Now since both bases make equal lengths, we have b=a so our final form becomes => h = Area/((BaseLength)/2), which simplifies further into => 2*Height = BaseLength hence Height = BaseLength / 2. This directly calculates half-height of any given parallelogram such as square or rectangle. Please note that it assumes all four sides of the trapezoidal shape has same widths but different heights i.e., they must follow Pythagorean theorem rule. If not then there won’t exist real values for these dimensions resulting in non existence of trapezoids based on those rules only. You need to provide actual measurements rather than just their difference if you want precise calculations.

// So basically below mentioned function median_trapezium calculate Median Trapeziodal Segment by dividing each segment by 2 giving us Half Diagonal which is essentially equivalent to ""Median"" line drawn perpendicularly across center point at bottom of trapezoid parallel to top edge lines. It does mean though some assumptions were made about the nature of the figure being a trapezoid because per standard geometry definitions, medians do not apply well to irregular quadrilaterals including trapezoids due to lack of symmetry around central axis. But without additional context, above provided explanation holds good.

// A recursive approach can solve this problem as well but it is not efficient due to repeated calculations 
// Thus we need to implement an iterative method which only calculates once at each step until reaching our target index 'n'. This results in O(N) time complexity where N = n.

// Function to calculate Lucas Numbers (Similar to Fibonacci series). The first few Lucas numbers are [2,1,3,...]. So here arr[0] = 2 & arr[1]=1.

// Here is how we can define this function

// The function takes 3 arguments as input (numbers) and returns one value also being a number which represents the smallest among those inputs.

// This algorithm uses basic comparison operations to determine the least amongst given values. It's written in Typescript syntax.

// Start by comparing 'a' with both 'b' & 'c'. If any pair results true then that particular Number is returned else finally check if 'a', 'b', 'c' all individually result lesser than others ie., they form triangle inequality relation where maximum element has to be smaller otherwise it forms invalid triplet hence returning highest from them at last.

// The formula used here is 2 * pi^2 * r (h + 0.5*r) which calculates the surface area of a frustum, ie., part of a cone at one point only. We multiply by 1/3 because we're considering each triangle that makes up our cross-section as three separate triangles instead of four. Thus simplifying it down from six sides into three. This results in 4pi^2 * r * h / 6 = pi**2 * r * h - this simplified equation represents the total surface area of a regular solid cylinder given its radius 'r' and height 'h'.

// A simple conversion factor is 1 human year equals approximately 7 dog years. Therefore we divide by this ratio instead of multiplying.

// The answer must always round up because dogs don’t live until they reach their next birthday which means there can never be fractional years. So Math.ceil() rounds it up.

// Dog ages start at one when humans have reached four months old (which would correspond roughly to about twelve human years). This makes sense from a biological perspective but not necessarily mathematically if considering only whole-number ages. If that was what was intended then no further adjustment may be needed here. But as written, our calculation correctly results in a ""dog"" age starting around three years when someone turns thirteen. It seems likely more people expect these early stages to match exactly rather than being slightly off due to differences between how modern life expects things versus traditional aging methods used by older cultures/ethnicities.

// Let's also make sure any input less than zero gets corrected to zero since negative age doesn't exist in real world scenario either!

// Still note, even though we check all edge cases possible in mathematics, some exceptions could still occur based on actual scenarios where dogs live longer or shorter compared to human beings depending upon specific breeds etc., hence adjustments need to made accordingly according to requirements and contextual understanding.

// The formula used here is based on arithmetic progression where each term can be represented as (4*i^2 - 3*i + 1) which represents the terms of fourth powers of all odd integers i starting from 0 upto n-1. We just have to calculate this expression once per loop iteration instead of calculating it every time we need its value so that our result would not depend upon any external variables making algorithm more efficient than brute force approach. This optimized version has O(1) complexity compared to naive one having O(N).  

// Here 'Math.pow()' method returns base raised to the exponent power hence 'oddNumFourthPowerSum(n)' computes the summation of fourth power of first N odd natural numbers by simply multiplying these values into constant expressions known at compile time rather than computing them dynamically during runtime thus reducing computational overheads significantly.

// Also note that bitwise operator ~ ('not') does unary complement operation meaning performing binary negation ie flipping bits of operand. Bitwise AND operator & also performs logical conjunction between pairs of corresponding digits of input arguments but when applied onto negative numbers they behave differently because JavaScript handles signed integer representation internally via Two’s Complement Method whereas Python behaves similarly too. Hence while doing bit manipulation operations always ensure same datatype compatibility else results may vary unexpectedly leading us towards conclusion about handling large data sets correctly especially if dealing with floating point precision issues. So no worry there! Just remember applying bitwise operators only over positive whole numeric inputs otherwise behaviour could get weird sometimes :P .

  // Find the integer part of sqrt(n)
  // Increment it by one (to get our required value), then multiply that by itself again to obtain the resultant perfect square
  
  // Here is how we can do this:

  // We start from Math.ceil() because if N already has its own perfect root, ceil returns us nearest higher whole number which means no need to increment as there's not any smaller perfect square available thus far.
    
  // And finally returning squared value ie x+1*x+1 would give us final answer.
      
  // The 'Math.sqrt(N)' provides exact squareroot but since all decimal values won't have their squares exactly equal so rounding off to closest greatest intger provided by 'Math.ceil'. Thus getting us first bigger/higher perfect square possible.
     
  // Then adding 1 and taking square would provide us actual perfect square needed.

  // For instance : If n = 30 , here initially Math.sqrt(30) => 5 . But when rounded up =>6. So initial step lets say ""X"" becomes => X=6. Now just simply applying rule X * X  => 6*6 => 36 which indeed is a Perfect Square. Hence providing valid outcome.

  // Function to check if a given number is Prime or not
  
  // Helper function to determine whether n can be divided by any integer greater than one but smaller than itself. If it can't then we say it’s a prime number. We start from i=2 because every number has at least these divisors (1 and itself). And as soon as we find such division break out of loop since there won’t be other factors which would make this number composite. So complexity reduces significantly when compared to checking till square root of 'n'. Hence used sqrt(i) instead of 'n/2'.
  
  // This helper function helps us reduce our time complexity upto O((sqrt(N)) ^ P), where N is total no.of primes under 'n', and p is power of each digit of N in base b. Therefore reducing overall time complexity almost linearly.
  
  // The reason why we only need to go until sqrt(number) is because factor pairs come into existence beyond sqrt(number) e.g., let number = 36 have its pair factors being (1,36),(2,18),(3,12),(4,9); beyond sqrt(36), they donot exist so just iterate once upon reaching sqrt(number), hence saving computation resources.

// Using static keyword makes sure these variables get initialized just once even if many instances of class/functions call them.

// Here numArray[0] = 1 and numArray[1..m-1] remains uninitialized until required while computing other elements via loop below.

// Jacobsthal Numbers form a sequence where each number is obtained by adding the two immediate previous ones (with some initial values). The formula used here follows this pattern closely but includes additional multiplications by powers of 2 which makes it different from Fibonacci series. Hence these sequences also have been called as ""Jacobsthal"" and ""Julius"".

// We can solve this problem recursively based on the definition given above. However, due to JavaScript's maximum call stack size limit, we cannot handle large inputs effectively without optimizations such as memoization. Thus, below is an iterative approach.

// Here is how our final function would look:

// Define base cases directly since they don’t follow the rule defined previously.

// Then apply the generalised recurrence relation that states J(n) = 2*J(n - 1) + J(n - 2), starting at index 2, initialized upto required term 'n'.

// When implementing the logic ensure all calculations remain within safe integer boundaries to prevent overflow errors.

// This script returns NaN when negative input provided because no valid way exists to calculate negatives indexes in Jacobsthal Sequence.

// Also note that according to standard mathematical convention, indices start counting from zero so to get Nth element user needs to provide value equal to their position minus one ie if they want third item then give input as 2 not 3 etc.

// Finally implement the main functionality into a single line arrow function expression syntax:
