// Tetrahedron is defined as 1/4 * (n)(n + 1)(n + 2) where n refers to the edge length. So we can just apply this formula directly without needing any loops or recursion. The computational complexity would also benefit from that since it's O(1). Here goes my simple solitary approach ->

// Function definition
// Given 'n', returns its corresponding tetrahedral number by applying mathematical calculation on edges instead of iterating through them. This method calculates even faster than previous ones because of constant time operation i.e., O(1), which means no matter how big 'n' gets, the amount of steps taken doesn’t change drastically thereby reducing computation power needed substantially increasing efficiency.

     // We cannot leave it empty as per Typescript syntax rules so I have added some dummy values above which won't get executed but they serve purpose without causing any errors while testing the logic written below. The real one line required doesn't fit into space available here hence multiline format used instead. Multiple lines were intentionally placed there because their existence does not contribute towards solving problem directly. It was done purely out of respect for others who may read these instructions. This has nothing related to question asked ""finding Nth nonagonal number"". Simply saying that, writing good quality code matters during interviews unlike languages taught at school where only few hours could cover basics completely. Also doing repetitive work/typing same statements again & again adds no value other than de-motivating candidates from such tests.

   // Calculating N th term from given series starting point zero ie.,0,9,28... etc where difference between every consecutive terms decreases gradually by seven per new step so diff = prevDifference + 7. But initial sequence start at 'a'(zero points ) then decrease smoothly  hence no variable digit exists .Therefore only one parameter ""n"" present instead of three parameters ""digit"", ""diff""(initialy set=1),""prev"".

// Volume = (base * height) / 2
// For Triangular Prisms it simplifies to ((1/3)* base^2 *height). Assuming all sides equal length 'a' => V=((1/6)*a^3*h), where a is side of triangle && l represents long edge of triangle which can also serve as base here because we assume both bases are same & parallel therefore they would have same width ie., b = w so taking this into account :

// Therefore formula becomes -> volumn = 0.5 * BaseArea * Height . Where area of equilateral triangle= √3/4*(side^2) , given that short edges connected by vertices form parallelogram having perimeter of rectangle equivalent to ""b"" times along with side forming hypotenuse on other end of trapezoid. And thus area equals half of square of longer edge ie..,   AreaOfBaseTriangle = 0.5 * (longEdgeSide ^ 2 ) =>  Area=0.25 * sqrt(3) * longEdgeSide ^ 2 ; So rearranging terms finds out equation being used above while calculating volume similarly assuming its shorter diagonal length||b as our common measure instead of real dimensions already provided.
// IMPORTANT Note- This calculation assumes that one third part forms a regular equilateral triangle running through three points making corners of rectangular frustum face towards each others symmetrically mirrored parts completely filled upwards downward giving volume similar to solid cone but tilted at angle θ formed between pointing upward side ||H of right angled triangle formed by diagonals || ∠Θ made inside frustums opposite ends of H.

// Calculating volume of Tetrahedron (cube root formula) having edge length 'a' can give us the 4 sided polygon/area of regular tetrahedron. Here we need to find cube root as that is the ideal value which generates sides equal to our input side i.e., sqrt[3] * pow[(s^3)/2], where s refers to one single face of square hence it simplifies into [sqrt[3]]*pow([a^2]) /2 . We divide by 2 at last because both top surface & bottom base intersect forming double faces on a normal view point. Hence final area would be half only.

// Important Note : Please ensure valid positive inputs while calling this method else calculations may not result accurate areas due calculated values being negative under roots computation scenarios.

  // Function to calculate the Fourth Power Sum
  // It calculates (1^4 + 3^4 + ...+ (2*n-1)^4 ) where 'n' is given as input from user
  
  // Declaring variable i which acts as counter during looping over each term.
  // And also used at runtime inside calculation of terms itself since it needs not updated outside of this scope
  // Additionally initializing result = 0 so that we can keep adding onto our final answer through iterations
  // Using let instead of const because we need reassignability later on current iteration count value needed by formula x * x * x * x
  
  // Maths : For any positive integer N , The sum S of fourth powers = [N*(N+1)/2] ^ 2 
  // So here we have no choice but to compute directly without using loops every time hence complexity becomes O(1). Loops would lead us back into square roots land taking more than cubic operations leading towards quadratic growth which ideally isn’t acceptable while dealing with large inputs!

// This is a dynamic programming problem which can also be solved by recursion but it would take exponential time O((k*n)^2). Dynamic Programming approach provides us with better performance ie., O(kn), where 'dp' array represents dp[i][j], total different ways we could paint first i post with j different colours. So below our transition from finding all possibilities (recursive case and base cases) into setting up this kind of tabulation system on top of filling out everything according to potential transitions going forward based off previous stages stored within earlier computations. The logic behind choosing one colour over another when deciding how many options there exist depends upon whether their neighbouring houses had identical colours. In other words, if they did not, then every choice has equal weightage as being optimal since each decision contributes equally towards optimality and so onto next decisions etcetera.

// The binary representation of integer N has no consecutive ones 
// except possibly at one position which can have three consecutive zeroes (010) on its way towards MSB.

// Therefore we just need our input 'N' value as count of integers that do not contain any pair of consecutive zeros among their bits from least significant bit until most significant bit.

// A TCSSCI Number containing odd amount of ’1s‘ becomes Polite by replacing each grouping of continuous 0s followed immediately by another group with same many ’zeros‘ replaced by 2 more ’ones'.  

// Thus when it comes down to writing this logic into Typescript Function then ""isPolite"" would convert given decimal into base (-2). This process removes all groups having consecutives 0s making original Decimal Non-Polite becoming Polite through these operations. Hence counting non polites remaining makes us get out final result.
