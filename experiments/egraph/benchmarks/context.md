Consider a toy functional language for expressions consisting of identifiers, integers, basic arithmetic operations, function application, and let expressions.
For example, syntactically valid programs would include:

let x = 42 in
let y = f x in
y - 3

f x + g y

Please refactor the following program into an *equivalent* one with good style. Your snippet should follow the syntax implied by the grammar above. Do not add comments or use any features not mentioned above. The original program is:
